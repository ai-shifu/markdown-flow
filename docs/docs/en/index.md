# Getting Started

## What is MarkdownFlow?

MarkdownFlow (also known as MDFlow or markdown-flow) extends standard Markdown with AI to create personalized, interactive pages. Its tagline is **"Write Once, Deliver Personally"**.

Instead of writing static content for readers, you write prompts for AI agents. These agents transform your instructions into personalized content that adapts to each user's choices, preferences, and context.

## Complete Compatibility with Markdown

**MarkdownFlow is not a replacement for Markdown — it's a natural extension:**

- ✅ All standard Markdown syntax works unchanged
- ✅ All Markdown extensions (tables, task lists, footnotes) work normally  
- ✅ Existing Markdown documents work in MDFlow without modification
- ✅ Your favorite Markdown editors and toolchains continue to work

You can start with any existing Markdown document and gradually add MDFlow features as needed.

## Three Simple Extensions

MarkdownFlow adds three new syntax elements to standard Markdown:

!!! tip "Remember the Core Principle"
    All examples below show **AI instructions**, not direct user content. You write prompts for AI to generate personalized content.

### 1. Variables

Dynamic content placeholders that get replaced with actual values.

```markdown
Generate a welcoming message for {{user_name}} that mentions their
current account balance of {{balance}} in a friendly tone.
```

**Learn more:** [Variables Specification](specification/variables.md)

### 2. Interactive Elements

Buttons and input fields that collect user choices and store them in variables.

```markdown
Ask the user about their experience level and store the response.
?[%{{level}} Beginner | Intermediate | Expert]

Ask the user about their habits. Can be single or multiple choice.
?[%{{habits}} Movies || Sports || Reading || Traveling]

Collect the user's name in a friendly way.
?[%{{name}}...Enter your name here]
```

### 3. Preserved Content

Text that maintains its exact meaning and style during AI processing.

```markdown
Introduce our company values, making sure to preserve the exact motto:
===Innovation Through Simplicity===

Provide installation instructions, preserving the exact command:
===npm install markdown-flow===
```

## How It Works (Simple Version)

A **MarkdownFlow Agent** processes your document by:

1. Reading your MDFlow document (AI instructions)
2. Incorporating reader's personalized information through variables
3. Calling a Large Language Model with these combined instructions
4. Generating personalized content unique to each reader
