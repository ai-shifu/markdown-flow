## üìö Best Practices

### Writing Effective MDFlow Documents

#### 1. Start Simple, Iterate

```markdown
# Version 1: Basic
Welcome {{name}}!

# Version 2: Add interaction
Welcome! What's your name?
?[%{{name}}...Enter name]
Nice to meet you, {{name}}!

# Version 3: Add personalization
Welcome! What's your name?
?[%{{name}}...Enter name]

What brings you here?
?[%{{goal}}Learning|Building|Exploring]

Generate a warm welcome for {{name}} who is {{goal}}.
```

#### 2. Be Specific with AI Instructions

```markdown
# Too vague ‚ùå
Tell the user about {{topic}}.

# Clear and specific ‚úÖ
Explain {{topic}} to a {{level}} user in exactly 3 paragraphs:
1. Core concept (50 words)
2. Practical example from {{industry}} (75 words)
3. Action they can take today (50 words)
```

#### 3. Plan User Journeys

Map out different paths users might take:

- New user ‚Üí Onboarding ‚Üí Basic features
- Returning user ‚Üí Skip intro ‚Üí Advanced options
- Expert user ‚Üí Direct access ‚Üí Power features

#### 4. Test Edge Cases

Always consider:

- Empty inputs
- Very long inputs
- Special characters
- Different languages
- Unexpected combinations

### Common Patterns

#### Progressive Disclosure

```markdown
Show basic info about {{topic}}.

Want more details?
?[%{{more}}Yes, tell me more|No, that's enough]

If {{more}} is "Yes": provide in-depth explanation
If {{more}} is "No": summarize and conclude
```

#### Contextual Adaptation

```markdown
Explain {{concept}} using analogies from {{user_background}}:
- If tech: use programming examples
- If business: use market scenarios
- If creative: use artistic metaphors
```

#### Feedback Loops

```markdown
Was this helpful?
?[%{{feedback}}Very helpful|Somewhat helpful|Not helpful]

If "Not helpful": ask what they need clarification on
If "Somewhat helpful": offer additional resources
If "Very helpful": suggest next topics
```

## üõ† Development Tips

### 1. Version Control

Track your MDFlow templates in Git:

```bash
# Good practice: separate templates
templates/
  onboarding.md
  tutorial.md
  feedback.md
```

### 2. Template Organization

```markdown
# Template Header
<!--
  Template: User Onboarding
  Version: 1.2.0
  Variables: name, role, experience
  Last Updated: 2024-03-15
-->

# Content starts here...
```

### 3. Variable Documentation

Keep track of your variables:

```markdown
<!-- Variables Used:
  {{user_name}} - User's display name
  {{user_role}} - Selected role (student/teacher/admin)
  {{course_id}} - Current course identifier
-->
```

### 4. Testing Strategy

Create test cases for your templates:

```javascript
const testCases = [
  { name: "Alice", role: "student", level: "beginner" },
  { name: "Bob", role: "teacher", level: "expert" },
  { name: "ÁâπÊÆäÂ≠óÁ¨¶ÊµãËØï", role: "admin", level: "intermediate" }
];
```

?[Button Text//value]                     # Different display/value

# Input
?[...Enter text]                          # Text input
?[%{{var}}...Enter text]                  # Store input text

# Preserved Content
===Exact text===                          # Preserve formatting/meaning

# Combined
?[%{{choice}}Yes|No|...Other]            # Buttons + input
```

2. **Test often** - Try different user paths
3. **Get feedback** - Share with real users
4. **Iterate** - Improve based on usage
5. **Share** - Help the community grow

**Remember:** The goal is to create content that adapts to each reader, making their experience personal and engaging.
