# Overview

MarkdownFlow is a natural extension of Markdown, not a replacement. Like GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) or CommonMark extensions that enhanced the original Markdown, MarkdownFlow adds new capabilities while maintaining complete compatibility.

## Complete Compatibility With Markdown

**All your Markdown knowledge and habits remain valid:**

- All standard Markdown syntax stays unchanged
- All Markdown extensions (tables, task lists, footnotes, etc.) work normally
- Existing Markdown documents work in MarkdownFlow without modification
- Your favorite Markdown editors and toolchains continue to work

## Simple Example

Here's a standard Markdown document:

```markdown
# Welcome

This is a **standard** Markdown document.

- List item 1
- List item 2

> Quoted text

[Link](https://example.com)
```

This document behaves exactly the same in MarkdownFlow. You don't need to change anything.

Therefore, you can:

1. **Start from zero**: Use any Markdown document directly as a MarkdownFlow document
2. **Add gradually**: Add MarkdownFlow features as needed
3. **Mix freely**: Combine standard Markdown and MarkdownFlow syntax in the same document

## Adding MarkdownFlow Features

When you need personalization or interactivity, simply add MarkdownFlow's extended syntax:

```markdown
Say hello to {{user_name}}!

Ask about user's **experience level** on Markdown with three options: beginner, intermediate, and expert.

?[%{{level}} Beginner | Intermediate | Expert]

The user's experience level is {{level}}.

Based on the level, recommend resources for further learning:

- If beginner: "Markdown for Dummies"
- If intermediate: "Mastering Markdown"
- If expert: don't learn any more, just do it
```

A user named John may get output from MarkdownFlow agent like this:

> Hello, John!
>
> Before we dive in, Iâ€™d like to gauge your experience with Markdown to tailor my help better. How would you **describe your skill level** with Markdown?
>
> - ðŸ˜Š **Beginner** (just starting or rarely use it)
> - ðŸš€ **Intermediate** (comfortable with basics like headers, lists, and links)
> - ðŸ§™ **Expert** (know advanced syntax like tables, footnotes, or HTML integration)
>
> Let me know, and Iâ€™ll adapt accordingly! ðŸ˜Š

Then, three buttons appear, and the user selects "Expert". Output continues:

> Since you're at the **Expert** level, the best approach is indeed to **"just do it"**â€”apply your skills in real-world projects, contribute to open-source documentation, or even create advanced Markdown guides for others.
>
> If you still want to push boundaries, consider:
>
> - Exploring **extended Markdown flavors** (CommonMark, GitHub Flavored Markdown, Pandoc Markdown).
> - Automating Markdown workflows with **scripts/tool**s\*\* (Pandoc, VS Code extensions, or custom parsers).
> - Writing **documentation-as-code** (combining Markdown with static site generators like MkDocs or Jekyll).
>   But honestly? Youâ€™ve got this. Go build something cool. ðŸš€

## Multi-Select Interaction Example

MarkdownFlow also supports button groups where readers can pick more than one answer:

```markdown
Ask how the reader would like to receive updates about the program.

?[%{{update_preferences}} Email||SMS||Push Notification||Weekly Recap]

Confirm their choices {{update_preferences}} and explain how you will use each channel.
```

Double pipes `||` signal that this block is multi-select, so the stored value becomes an array. You can still keep other button blocks in the same document single-selectâ€”the mode is decided within each block.

## Syntax Summary

MarkdownFlow's core syntax extensions:

- **Variables**: `{{variable_name}}` - Dynamic content placeholders
- **Interactive Elements**: `?[%{{variable}} Option1|Option2]` - Single-select buttons
- **Multi-Select Interaction**: `?[%{{variable}} Option1||Option2||Option3]` - Multi-select buttons
- **Text Input**: `?[%{{variable}} ...input hint]` - Text input field
- **Preserved Content**: `===content===` - Content not interpreted by AI

The above examples use MarkdownFlow's [Variable](variables.md) and [Button](button-input.md) features.
